Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a curated landing page that indexes my technical projects across analytics, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, ETL and streaming pipelines, business intelligence, and cloud-native MLOps. Each linked project contains reproducible code, notebooks, dataset sources or synthetic data generators, deployment examples (APIs, Docker), results visualizations, and concise executive summaries that highlight business value and key metrics. Use the project links below to access full case studies, quick-start instructions, and reproducibility steps.
